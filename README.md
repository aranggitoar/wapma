# WhatsApp Personal Message Automation (WAPMA)
A desktop application for sending bulk personal messages in WhatsApp Web
automatically. It utilises the Tkinter library for its desktop GUI and Selenium
library for its automation.

For now it is only available for Windows and Linux. Also only capable of using
Google Chrome as the browser.

WAPMA is still a Work In Progress.
